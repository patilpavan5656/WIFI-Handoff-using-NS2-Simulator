This project simulates Wi-Fi handoff processes using the NS2 (Network Simulator 2) to study the effects of handoff events on network performance. The simulation models a mobile node transitioning between overlapping Wi-Fi access points, allowing us to observe key performance metrics like latency, packet loss, and throughput during handoff. The primary goal is to evaluate the efficiency of handoff mechanisms by recording how these parameters change as the node switches connections. The environment is customizable, with options to adjust parameters such as mobility speed, signal strength, and access point range to explore different handoff scenarios. The projectâ€™s requirements include NS2, along with tools like AWK or Perl for processing output trace files and extracting performance metrics. By running the provided TCL scripts in NS2 and analyzing the output data, users can gain insights into handoff delays, packet loss, and overall throughput. This project is designed to support further development, with potential extensions including advanced handoff techniques or simulations under varying network conditions, such as different wireless protocols or mobility models
